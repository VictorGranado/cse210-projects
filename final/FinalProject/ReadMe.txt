Introduction:

Welcome to the Financial Reports Program! This program is designed to help you manage your budget and generate various financial reports to 
track your income, expenses, and overall financial health.

With this program, you can create weekly and monthly budgets to monitor your income and expenses. You can enter multiple income and expense 
values for each period, allowing for a detailed breakdown of your financial transactions. The program calculates the total income and expenses 
for the selected period, providing you with a clear overview of your budget.

In addition to budgeting, this program also generates financial reports such as profit and loss statements and expenditure reports. The profit 
and loss report compares your total income with your total expenses, giving you insights into your financial performance. The expenditure report 
provides a breakdown of your expenses for a selected period.

Furthermore, the program allows you to project future expenses and income based on historical data. By analyzing your spending patterns, you can 
forecast potential expenses and income, helping you make informed financial decisions.

You can also view and analyze your financial data in a spreadsheet format, making it easier to visualize and understand your budget and financial 
reports.

To enhance flexibility, the program provides options to save and load your budget and financial reports to/from CSV files. This allows you to
persist your data and resume your financial tracking at any time.

With the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, the Financial Reports Program provides a modular and extensible
solution for managing your budget and generating meaningful financial reports. It helps you gain better control over your finances and make 
informed decisions for a secure financial future.
